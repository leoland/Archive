These were some recent client full builds. motly built out of Helio's pre-Gutenberg block framework, they can be seen live at the following urls:

Vermont Mountainbike Association: https://vmba.org/
Some stuff has changed since my original build but it remains largely my build.

Kedrion Portal: https://iir.kedrion.us/
Much of this site is a maze of forms behind logged in user flags. Never the less it was a fun excercise in matching their current site and making it as accesible as the client feedback loop allowed. 

The future is now Conference: https://thefutureisnow.2civility.org/
sadly a victim of covid times, however last I heard they were planning on using the site next year with some fresh content.

Access to Justice: https://atjprod.wpengine.com/
not live yet.
